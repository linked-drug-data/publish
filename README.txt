1. This project contains several source codes necessary for querying over Linked Drug Database.2. To demonstrate SPARQL queries, you should prepare five rdf files in './rdf' directory.3. Two files 'sider_201506.nq' and 'medis_201506.nq' are already prepared.4. But other three files named 'usp_201512.nq', 'atc_201512.nq', and 'kegg_201512.nq' are not prepared because of licence matter.5. So, you can get these files by running 'MakeRDF.py', which requires python version 3.*.6. Then you can try SPARQL queries below from your terminal, which identify individual drug codes based on the details of drug properties.# Query 1: # Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as "renin angiotensin inhibitors" in ATC Classification System # Results: 476 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q1.rq# Query 2: # Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as "atypical antipsychotic drugs" in USP Classification System. They also have 5HT2C or H1 receptor inhibitory effects, which are defined by KEGG.# Results: 79 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/usp_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q2.rq# Query 3: * This query may take several minutes.# Description: Querying individual drug codes that may cause leukopenia or neutropenia as adverse events, which are defined by SIDER.# Results: 131 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --data ./rdf/sider_201506.nq --query ./queries/q3.rq
