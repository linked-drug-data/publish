## Welcome to Linked Drug DatabaseThis project contains several rdf files and source codes necessary for querying over Linked Drug Database.To demonstrate SPARQL queries, you can following instructions.## Getting Started1. Make sure that Python 3.5 or later and Java 1.7 or later are installed.2. Unzip ./rdf/medis_201506.nq.zip and ./rdf/sider_201506.nq.zip3. Run 'MakeRDF.py' to get the other RDF files.4. Make sure that you have five RDF files below in ./rdf folder.   medis_201506.nq, sider_201506, atc_201512.nq, usp_201512.nq, kegg_201512.nq5. Then you can try SPARQL queries below from your terminal, which identify individual drug codes based on the details of drug properties.# Query 1: # Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as "renin angiotensin inhibitors" in ATC Classification System # Results: 476 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q1.rq# Query 2: # Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as "atypical antipsychotic drugs" in USP Classification System. They also have 5HT2C or H1 receptor inhibitory effects, which are defined by KEGG.# Results: 79 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/usp_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q2.rq# Query 3: * This query may take several minutes.# Description: Querying individual drug codes that may cause leukopenia or neutropenia as adverse events, which are defined by SIDER.# Results: 131 Rows. ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --data ./rdf/sider_201506.nq --query ./queries/q3.rq
