## Welcome to Linked Drug DatabaseThis project demonstrates SPARQL queries that make use of five kinds of drug data sets to identify individual drug codes used in Japan.To try queries, you can download this project and do following instructions.## Getting Started1. Make sure that Python 3.1 or later and Java 1.7 or later are installed.2. Unzip ./rdf/medis_201506.nq.zip and ./rdf/sider_201506.nq.zip3. Run 'MakeRDF.py' to get the other RDF files.        $ python MakeRDF.py4. Make sure that you have five RDF files in ./rdf folder.        medis_201506.nq, sider_201506, atc_201512.nq, usp_201512.nq, kegg_201512.nq5. Then you can try SPARQL queries below from your terminal, which identify individual drug codes based on the details of drug properties.## Query 1: Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as 'renin angiotensin inhibitors' in ATC Classification System. Results: 476 Rows.      $ ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q1.rq## Query 2: Description: Querying individual drug codes that are classified as 'atypical antipsychotic drugs' in USP Classification System. They also have 5HT2C or H1 receptor inhibitory effects, which are defined by KEGG. Results: 79 Rows.      $ ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/usp_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --query ./queries/q2.rq## Query 3: Description: Querying individual drug codes that may cause 'leukopenia' or 'neutropenia' as adverse events, which are defined by SIDER. Results: 131 Rows. This query may take several minutes.      $ ./apache-jena-3.0.0/bin/arq --data ./rdf/atc_201512.nq --data ./rdf/medis_201506.nq --data ./rdf/kegg_201512.nq --data ./rdf/sider_201506.nq --query ./queries/q3.rq
